#  LinearRegressionModel

A machine learning project analyzing honey production trends across the United States from 1998 to 2012. The project applies linear regression to understand production decline over time and predict future trends.

---

## 📈 Overview
This project uses data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to explore how honey production has changed across U.S. states. It combines data analysis and machine learning techniques to draw insights and forecast production levels.

---

## 💡 Key Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in honey production nationally and by state
- Apply a linear regression model to predict future honey production
- Discuss insights on the observed decline

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## 📊 Dataset
Source: USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)  
Years Covered: 1998–2012  
Features: State, total production, yield per colony, number of colonies, price per pound, etc.

## 🔮 Model
A simple Linear Regression model is trained to fit the national honey production data over the years. The model is then used to predict future production and visualize trends.
